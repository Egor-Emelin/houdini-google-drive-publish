# houdini-google-drive-publish
Easy publishing from Houdini to Google Drive.  
The HDA is fairly self-explanatory.  
You need to set the path, save the file, and publish it to Google Drive.  

Make sure you have all necessary libraries installed in your environment.  
In the code, you need to set the path to your JSON credentials file, which you can obtain from the Google Cloud Platform.  
Additionally, you need to enable the Google Drive API in the Library section (check this article for a better understanding: [https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-upload-file-to-google-drive/](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-upload-file-to-google-drive/)).  

I store the Python code in the HDA's `PythonModule`, but you can store it anywhere and call it from the `PythonModule`.
